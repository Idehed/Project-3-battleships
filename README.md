# How to play

Battleship is a strategy type guessing game for two players.

It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each player's fleet of warships are marked.
 
The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.

The grid in this battleship game is a 10*10 board with 5 ships that are randomly placed for both the player and the computer.
The guesses that are misses are marked with a "O" and the guesses that are a hit are marked with a "X".

The winner is the one who get 15 shots at the opposites ships first.
